Two-Colorable

Implement a function that checks if an undirected graph (given as an adjacency list) is two-colorable â€” meaning you can assign one of two colors to each node so that no connected nodes share the same color.
If the graph contains a self-loop, it is automatically not two-colorable.

Example
Input:
edges = [
  [1, 2],
  [0, 2],
  [0, 1]
]
Output: False
# Node 0 connects to both 1 and 2, but 1 and 2 also connect to each other,
# making it impossible to assign only two colors.
