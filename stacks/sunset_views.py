Sunset Views

Implement a function that, given an array of building heights and a facing direction ("EAST" or "WEST"), returns the indices of the buildings that can see the sunset.
A building can see the sunset if itâ€™s taller than all buildings that appear after it in the direction it faces.
Return the indices in ascending order.

Example 1
Input:
buildings = [3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2]
direction = "EAST"
# Visual representation of the input:
#              _
#            _| |
#          _| | |_
#        _| | | | |_
#  (E)  | | | | | | |  (W)
#
Output: [1, 3, 6, 7]

Example 2
Input:
buildings = [3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2]
direction = "WEST"
Output: [0, 1]
