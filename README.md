### My Algorithmic Playground

This repo is my working catalogue of algorithms and data structure problems â€” a mix of practice, pattern discovery, and optimization.

Each file is structured for clarity:
```python
"""
Problem statement
"""
<solution_code_here>
```

The problems are organized by category (arrays, stacks, trees, graphs, etc.), showcasing different problem-solving patterns and implementation approaches in Python.
